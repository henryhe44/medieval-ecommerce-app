### FAQs
##### Why did you build this?
Because I'm a nerd that likes Age of Empires, Warhammer Fantasy and 40k... And well, there really isn't anything better to do while in quarantine.

##### Any plans to write a backend?
Only tentative ones. I'm thinking of using MongoDB because you would need mongoose and a connection string to pull data. Setup should be quicker compared to something like SQL... that and Oracle SQL developer has traumatized me. I'm not touching that or PL-SQL unless I've been bribed and imbibed. 

##### What is the Air-Speed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?
Someone else answered that [here](https://medium.com/human-nature-group/what-is-the-air-speed-velocity-of-an-unladen-swallow-4c17087bbf33).

##### Why aren't there any bows or ranged weapons?
Because real men engage in **GLORIOUS MELEE COMBAT**!... In all honesty, I'm being a minimalist with this app until I write a proper backend for this.

##### You know the README.md is an important document that shows vital details for your app right?
And...? 

##### And your FAQs is littered with jokes and unhelpful responses and silly jokes.
Normal people won't reading up to this point. :D Probably.
